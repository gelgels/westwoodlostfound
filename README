Westwood Lost and Found

This is a lost-and-found website built for the UCLA community. I chose to create a lost-and-found tool for Westwood students because other websites, such as Spotted on Bruinwalk, were bombarded with lost-and-found posts.

It can be forked for your own community, but I won't promise that s/westwood/pleasantville/g will work.
